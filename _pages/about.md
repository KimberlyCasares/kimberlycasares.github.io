Bio
======
kimberly Casares is a a PhD student in Bioinformatics at the Univeristy of Georgia, where she specializes in bacterial genomics and computational pipeline development. originally from new mexico, she earned her B.S. in Biology from New mexico state university. currently working in Dr. Tatum Mortimers lab, in the department of microbiology and population health. Kimberly's current focus is on building snakemake pipelines for whole genome assembly and analysis of bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae. Her research combines phylogenetic analysis with genomic epidemiology to understand pathogen transmission patterns and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. prior to her doctoral studie, she gained extensive research experience through research programs including a USDA-funded REU at the University of Georgia studying Agave genomics and an NSF funded internship at UT el paso investigating Chihuahuan desert microbial communities. Kimberly is Bilingual in enlgish and spanish and contributes to the scientific community through conference presentations and her work developing open source bioinformatics tools for pathogen surveillance.
