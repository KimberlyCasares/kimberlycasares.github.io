## Genomic Epidemiology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Rhode Island
### Overview: Analyzing whole genome sequencing data to understand transmission patterns and antibiotic resistance distribution in N. gonorrhoeae isolates from Rhode Island.
#### Methodology:
•	De novo genome assembly using SPAdes
•	Quality assessment with FastQC and assembly metrics
•	Phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood methods
•	Recombination detection and removal with Gubbins
•	Variant calling and comparative genomics
### Research Questions:
•	How is gonorrhea affecting this community?
•	What genes are involved in resistance and susceptibility?
•	What are the transmission patterns between demographic groups?
### Key Findings: 
[To be updated as research progresses]
### Tools:
SPAdes, FastQC, Prokka, Pilon, RAxML, Gubbins
